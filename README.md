### Chemotaxis: A Novel Way of Solving Mazes in a Simulator 
#### Abstract:
This research has re-implemented Teddy's self-generated chemotaxis model and analyzed the results from different situations based on a multi-level reservoir. Tweedy has brought up the theory that with self-generated local gradients by breaking down nearby attractants, cells can navigate and find the unobstructed path of complex mazes. I have built a program with JavaScript to simulate the depletion of cells and the diffusion of attractant; our result indicates cells are able to detect the expected paths before entering the junction according to the dynamic gradient. A maze generation method has also been built for the simulation by using the backtracking algorithm; further research may take advantage of it in case of quick setup.


#### Introduction:
The maze is a complicated and confusing network of intercommunicating passages that requires people to identify the most optimal route from entrance to the terminus without loss in the dead ends. People have been fascinated with mazes for thousands of years through different forms in various cultures, which is reflected in buildings, patterns, and games. Notably, mazes are also known as a labyrinth in that they both depict a complex collection of pathways, but the two do differ in certain ways. For instance, some people consider the labyrinth to be unicursal, which only has a single route with various turns to its center (destination). Meanwhile, mazes feature multiple branches that puzzle people to its dead ends. Specifically, the word “maze” first appeared in the 13th Century, and is derived from the Old English word ‘mæs,’ which means delusion, or perplex. However, the origins of the word maze may have come from the Neolithic period. Notably, the first renowned maze in history must be from the Geek island of Crete. The maze was built by the inventor, Daedalus, to hold a monster with the head and tail of a bull and the body of a man—the Minotaur of Greek mythology. According to mythology and logic, this construction should house complicated multi-branches to trap the Minotaur, so it is indeed a maze rather than a labyrinth. Additionally, the seven-circuit labyrinth is another Cretan magnificent labyrinth composed of seven intertwining concentric circles as shown in Figure 1 [1]. Although the labyrinth appears chaotic and confusing with entirely semicircular paths, there is only one single route to its center. Notbaly, the labyrinth’s symbol was first used on clay tablets in Greek palaces in 1200 BC and was later introduced to Western Europe as a type of decoration in the following centuries. Throughout Europe, mazes have achieved their grand expression in some gothic cathedrals, where there are numerous grandiose pavement labyrinths painted in the floor such as in the Chartres Cathedral of France. Notably, they were used for pilgrimage and people referred to it as the Road of Jerusalem—a search journey to be closer to God. Currently, urban mazes are most often seen in movies, and they act as a symbol representing dangerous or challenging things such as The Shining, Harry Potter or The Maze Runner.

Chemotaxis is defined as the response generated by the organism for the chemical stimulus from the external environment such as when cells guide their movements according to the nutrient concentration. Most bacterial chemotaxis is basic and simple—the gradients between the chemical attractant source and the sink will remain static. Under such circumstances, it does not possess capabilities to direct the cells for a long distance, particularly when the distance is over 500 μm [5]. However, some studies have demonstrated that few somatic cells are able to do cell migration through complicated places like human’s tissues. Notably however, Neutrophils are a type of primary cells of humans, and they will be recruited when an inflammation occurs which leads to an immune system response. They are the first white blood cell population to reach and manage the host infection with such significant numbers, and their rapid response can largely be attributed to the chemotaxis or guided cell migration [3]. Notably, Neutrophils are remarkably sensitive to the stimulus—they are able to move to higher concentration areas according to extracellular chemical gradients made from diverse chemoattractants. Additionally, they will break down those different attractants, follow the chemo signals in a hierarchical way and eventually arrive at the inflammation site. The same phenomenon also occurs in tumour cells [4]. In cancer, chemotaxis is relative to each step of tumour cell dissemination, and it directs the behaviour of tumour cells while controling the cancer’s metastatic spread. Tweedy et al. [6] recently identified that these cells also possess the striking ability to navigate complex routes or even solve mazes by using self-generated chemotaxis. Through decomposing the nearby attractant fluid, cells can create dynamic gradients in front of them— thus avoiding dead ends and reaching a promising branch where there is a higher average concentration. Both results from software simulators and living cells experiments have demonstrated the power of cells in solving complex mazes using self-generated chemotaxis. This project seeks to re-implement Tweedy’s simulator to test the result of their findings and conduct further improvements based on the study.
#### Related Work:
My field of research was originally inspired by Braitenberg’s [2] vehicles. He came up with a hypothetical simple robot that could move autonomously according to nearby stimuli. According to his description, each vehicle is attached to multiple pairs of sensors for detecting various stimuli in the environment, and is driven by a pair of motors linked to those sensors. Depending on the distance between a given stimulus and the left and right sensors, each motor can generate a different velocity, thus enabling the vehicle to turn its head. By adding crossed wiring between the sensors and motors, and allowing the motors to run forward or in reverse, the vehicle can either pursue or avoid a given stimulus or object, thus allowing it to express its emotional reactions to the objects it encounters, like love or fear. The vehicle’s logic also includes thresholds for reaction time; this is a way to control the relationship between internal and external forces as well as the vehicle’s velocity. For instance, the vehicle will react to irritating stimuli in the same manner that single-celled creature would, which makes the simulation more realistic. 


Xu and Kaplan [7] have invented a method of transferring interesting regions and the tone of any photo into a maze. To construct a maze, they used the same method as the one described in design-centric maze generation: separating the photo or object into pieces, then constructing and connecting each cell together using a spanning tree. To maintain the style or expression of the images, mazes have to be designed on a region-by-region basis. Xu and Kaplan defined the different regions and styles by four textures: directional mazes, spiral or vortex mazes, random mazes, and user-defined lines. Directional mazes are normal mazes with anisotropy where the walls are assigned to flow with two perpendicular directions. I have introduced the spiral mazes with Berg’s article; this style can be used for depictions of specific objects, such as a round teapot. Random mazes are used for regions that can be defined by tone variation, and user-defined lines are used for faces that need to carefully pointed out.


Other useful effects to improve the visual appeal of a maze include tone reproduction and foreshortening. To remake the tone, Xu and Kaplan also defined a relationship between line spacing, line width, and lightness. The lighter tones usually have thinner line width, with broader spaces between each line (wall) in the region. By contrast, dark tones have thicker, bolder lines, and darker tonal areas are more crowded. Meanwhile, foreshortening provides an interactive tool that can generate a perspective transformation based on the normal vectors of the photo. A designer can finish their mazes according to the inverse of that transformation, then re-apply the transformation to generate the foreshortening effect.

#### Methodology: 
Chemotactic cells use receptors to analyze the gradient in different areas then move to their preferable region. However, it should be noted that they are only able to identify the differences that are over 1% between the nearby areas. When they enter a dilute or concentrated fluid with less than 1% occupancy difference, those cells cannot make decisions nor navigate to further distances. Nevertheless, if cells have the ability to decompose the attractant fluid, the diffusion will begin and a local gradient can be created, and the result will become much better. 


Diffusion also plays an imperative role in a self-generated gradient. After cells consume their nearby attractant fluid, the fresh, concentrated fluid area will begin to diffuse toward the cell areas where the fluid is scarce, and the gradients are formed. In a regular two branch reservoir, the same amount of cells will theoretically stay in each branch—since the branch with more cells will manifest low average gradients based on the depletion. In this manner, the subsequent cells will always choose the branch that is less crowded. However, this balance will be broken once a branch becomes empty by the consumption, and in such an event, later cells will completely avoid it if the gradient is negligible. Moreover, short paths can even improve the efficiency of the self-generated gradient model. Notably, it is possible for the cells’ depletion and fluid diffusion to clear the attractant fluid from the short path. This is especially done before the cells reach the junction, in which case, the cells will sense their front gradients in advanced and make the expected decision for the branches without visiting. The decision’s accuracy is also related to a path’s length. For instance, most cells would avoid dead ends with short paths but produced errors from choosing between the long passages. The error rate is usually high in the beginning since the gradients are still forming in progress and decreases in both path distances with the depletion time. Later on, the decision becomes more accurate when the gradients are more complete. In addition, complex topologies should also affect the cells’ decisions. A shorter approach that connects to the junction may leave cells with a lack of time to break down the fluid in front of them and make inaccurate adjudgment. A wider dead end full of attractant fluid may also appears promising to cells. Although the performance of self-generated chemotaxis could be influenced by these variables in the simulator, the final result should still be what is expected after time elapse and depletion increase.


To randomly generate mazes in my program, I’ve chosen the recursive backtracking algorithm which is not only simple, but also understandable. In the backtracking algorithm, all possible choices or candidates will be formed as the nodes of this tree. Notably, the algorithm needs to recursively traverse the tree. Thus, we proceed to examine its child nodes at each node which is elicited by this parent node if the root is still promising. Otherwise, the current node is removed and we return to its parent node to examine its sibling until all viable solutions or some expected solutions from the tree are identified. In my program, each cell in the screen can either be a wall or the passage. To generate the maze, I first picked a cell as the starting point, then randomly choose one of its nearby cells as the wall. Notably, this nearby cell’s outer neighbour in the same direction as the passage if both new cells are unvisited and not out of bound. The new passage cell will become the new current cell. If all neighbours of the current cell are either out of bound or visited, we backtrack to its parent and repeat the previous steps. The backtracking may return to its ancestor node if the majority of the cells in the field are all be visited. Notably, the backtracking algorithm will end when we finally back all the way up to the initial node which means that there are no unvisited cells in the field. Additionally, this algorithm cannot guarantee to always make a solvable maze, further development may be needed if the experiment requires integrated mazes.

#### Result:
My first model with two branches reservoir has successfully revealed the efficiency of self-generated chemotaxis in long-range paths. The depletion will begin once the cells have spawned, and then the concentration of nearby areas will decrease because of the diffusion. Soon, the drought will spread to each branch when the cells are still in the junction approach. To make the model's diffusion clear and effective, I've increased the attractant fluid of exit, which is higher than normal. This concentration fluid will diffuse rapidly to nearly empty areas. The gradient is so significant that the later cells can be controlled by it before getting close to the high concentration fluid.

## Week 10
This project is inspired by the paper "Seeing around corners: Cells solve mazes and respond at a distance using attractant breakdown" published earlier this year. By observing the migration of neutrophils for engulfing bacteria of infection, Tweedy et al. have found the cells’ ability to navigate a complex path or solve a maze based on the self-generated chemotaxis. After filling the routes with attractant fluid, they let cells navigate and break down the fluid near them. The fluid from nearby high concentration areas will soon diffuse toward them; thus, the gradient is generated by the interplay between cells and the environment. The cells will sense and acquire the surrounding information about the environment and be headed toward the high concentration point which is the destination according to the gradients of attractant. My project aims to re-implement this new research finding from the simulator and perhaps explore more beyond it. 
Current ideas are analyzing the result; making a more attractive interaction program for the public to demonstrate the practicality of chemotaxis; embellishing or mutating the maze to become stylized.

Seeing around corners: Cells solve mazes and respond at a distance using attractant breakdown is a newly-released paper published earlier this year. Awareness of its findings quickly spread through news and videos because of the amazing phenomenon observed by the researchers: cells rapidly navigating and solving different levels’ mazes for the attractant. I was deeply inspired by the video when I viewed it for the first time, which led me to the idea of extending this research in a more artistic way by reimplementation since this research is primarily focused on the scientific aspects, like the experimental methodology. Berg’s website and books also made great contributions to the mazes’ artistic aspect. Most papers I’ve read have all cited Berg’s work as a basis for maze generation. I’d like to see the results of combining Xu and Kaplan’s method of transferring photorealistic images into mazes with Berg’s design principles. Currently, since the paper was just released on the end of this August, there are no published research studies or reimplementation attempts based on the results of Seeing around corners. I believe there is a lot to say about this subject in the future, and further discoveries to be made in this area, whether in the scientific aspect or the artistic aspect.

### Annotated Bibliography

##### Berg, C. Educational Maze Puzzle Art. Retrieved from http://www.amazeingart.com/

This website gives a generate description of different aspects of maze puzzles. The origins of labyrinths may rise from the Neolithic period, but the first renowned labyrinths in the history must be from the Geek island of Crete which built by the inventor, Daedalus, in order to hold a monster with the head and tail of a bull and the body of a man—the Minotaur of Greek mythology. The Cretan labyrinth, also as known as a seven circuit labyrinth, is another magnificent maze composed of seven intertwining concentric circles (Figure 1). Although the maze looks chaotic at first glance, there is only one directed path to its center.  The labyrinth’s symbol was first used on clay tablets in Greek palaces in 1200 BC, and was later introduced to Western Europe as a type of decoration in the following centuries. There are other old and classic mazes such as Roman mosaic, which usually was used as protective totem.

The website also discusses how to draw an aesthetically appealing maze. The basic skill involves the maze’s passages; for entry level maze design, no matter whether it is a curve or a straight path, the width of the passages must be consistent. The second thing to be aware of is the junctions: the passages that lead to a dead end shouldn’t be too short, otherwise people will be able to recognize and avoid it directly. Such maze design is wasteful. A good maze design should be multiply connected, which means there should be passages to dead ends and also some passages that lead back to earlier passages. Such mazes are challenging and time-consuming for every player. There are other advanced approaches that can make mazes more interesting and extraordinary, such as vortices, bottlenecks, and kernels.

Christopher Berg is the author of the book Amazeing Art: Wonders of the Ancient World. Although I have not yet had a chance to read the book, the author’s website provides a lot of detail about designing mazes, and explores the subject consistently and deeply. I intend to design my maze following his rules to avoid filling up blank spaces with odd shapes, which often happens at a later stage. I particularly like the approach involving spirals or vortices; although the pattern looks random, there is actually only one unobstructed path. It will be interesting to connect this design with other passages to confuse and astonish the participants However, the problem is that this pattern includes too many passages vertically or horizontally within each spiral; it will be lot of work to generate the dynamic gradient if I calculate the passages separately. 


##### Braitenberg, V. (1984). Vehicles, experiments in synthetic psychology (pp. 3-28). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.

My field of research was originally inspired by Braitenberg’s vehicles. He came up with a hypothetical simple robot that could move autonomously according to  nearby stimuli. According to his description, each vehicle is attached to multiple pairs of sensors for detecting various stimuli in the environment, and is driven by a pair of motors linked to those sensors. Depending on the distance between a given stimulus and the left and right sensors, each motor can generate a different velocity, thus enabling the vehicle to turn its head. By adding crossed wiring between the sensors and motors, and allowing the motors to run forward or in reverse, the vehicle can either pursue or avoid a given stimulus or object, thus allowing it to express its emotional reactions to the objects it encounters, like love or fear. The vehicle’s logic also includes thresholds for reaction time; this is a way to control the relationship between internal and external forces as well as the vehicle’s velocity. For instance, the vehicle will react to irritating stimuli in the same manner that single-celled creature would, which makes the simulation more realistic. Braitenburg’s book also mentions the evolution of the hypothetical machine by randomly changing the vehicles’ internal combinations that are eliminated, so that even after multiple generations, the vehicles are expected to adapt for long-term survival in the experimental environment.

Although no real agent models have been built to practice its functions, the concept Braitenberg introduced is quite sufficient for a basic simulation program. This made me realize how simple it is to generate an autonomous robot that looks and functions like a real organism, and I am eager to work on this model to create my own single-cell creature (a bacterium). However, the question of how to transform from a theoretical agent to a real world bacterial consistently still warrants a lot of consideration. If I were to put the conceptual vehicle into a dense field environment, such as full of sugar, the sensors would need to be modified to detect the density of adjacent areas. I could also use another pair of sensors or add another function to recognize edges; perhaps I could make the project with the Unity engine, as ray-tracing can be more efficient at detecting nearby objects compared to sensors.  

##### Hays, J., & Essa, I. (2004). Image and video based painterly animation. Proceedings of the 3rd International Symposium on Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering, 113–120. https://doi.org/10.1145/987657.987676

Hays and Essa introduced a technique to transform static images and dynamic videos into painterly animation corresponding to their original styles. In order to solve the problem of transformation between moving images, they developed a framework that could automatically generate dynamic brush strokes with different properties to depict each spatial and temporal detail. Brush strokes’ properties include opacity, RGB color, orientation, motion, length, width, and the anchor in the origin photo’s coordinates. To reproduce any coarse or fine painting, disjointed groups of strokes were used as layers for the painterly animation. The unifying artistic concept among these works is similar to the Impressionist style. 

The approach of absorbing information from image and video and reproducing on the canvas by strokes are based on seven steps:
•	A. initialization (initialized layer number depends on the style selected).
•	B. Motion (the motion of each stroke’s pixels transferred from one frame to another).
•	C. Regeneration and Refinement (the optical flow will make the canvas visible under the video sequences with motion, so new brush strokes are generated to render delicate details and prevent the occurrence of empty canvas).
•	D. Orientation (painters follow the contours of an image's features, and the motion noise could be decreased by gradient calculations, so constraining the orientation will be necessary).
•	E. Edge Clipping (emulate the process of artists maintaining the structural coherence by avoiding the edge crossing).
•	F. Color Extraction (each pixel’s color is extracted from the average color of the underlying layer, in order to avoid the color effect of video noise).
•	G. Rendering (rendering each brush stroke by the real brush painted texture as well as gray-scale alpha masks, from bottom layer to top layer).

The authors also introduced the idea that video sources and user-specified motions could add non-photorealistic animation. Through image-based flow visualization (IBFV), a single still image can be transformed into a movement. In this project, the authors calculated different steps and conditions, creating paint-like images and videos.

With regard to image- and video-based painterly animation, an influential art show—such as a Vincent van Gogh exhibition—could serve as a great visual explanation of paint-like animation’s visual appeal and facility. Painterly animation also incorporates the expressive style and the meaning of the filter itself without affecting the video content's expression. As a means of popularizing this medium, this project transforms traditional painting technology, which needs time to be polished, into a filter that can be used at any time. From the perspective of the analysis of painting techniques, the restoration degree is guaranteed to be the highest. It also saves time and energy spent on painting. 


##### Kim, P. H., Grove, J., Wurster, S., & Crawfis, R. (2019). Design-centric maze generation. Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games, 1–9. https://doi.org/10.1145/3337722.3341854

Kim et al. introduced their own maze generation method, which can produce specific properties according to designers’ input. There are a few existing maze generation tools, most of which are for game level design, but they are too simple and can only randomly generate mazes of a given size.  In order to make a chaotic multiple-branch maze for a “dungeons” game or long straightaways for a running game, it’s better for designers to input the expected topology and solutions to the tool additionally.

Kim et al consider the mazes as a spanning tree in a grid, where the nodes are the separated cells of the maze, and the edges are the lines between cell centers.  The core method of generation they used is called search based procedural content generation (SBPCG), which includes a searching mechanism. SBPCG first iteratively creates and compares the solution path of maze until it finds the result that corresponds to the user’s requirements; the solution path then will become a hard constraint and the later full maze generation will be forced to contain it. Because basic SBPCG may take infinite time to randomly generate a complex path to satisfy the requirement, an improved path generation method was developed to save time. This method generates edges (passages) column-by-column in the grid of a maze. The creation starts from left to right columns, so it builds vertical edges first and horizontal edges second, as shown in the Figure 2. It also needs to make sure each column is connected to its neighbors so that there is a valid solution throughout the generation process. For full maze generation, the researchers made a machine learning model which was trained to make spanning trees and find the desired result. To decrease the training data and the work of supervised learning for a large-sized maze, they also used a sophisticated method to separate the maze into smaller mazes to generate and concatenate.

I know all the data structures and algorithms mentioned in the article above but never used them in practice . It is quite innovative that some scientists can combine the data structure content and maze generation together. To build and test my initial project, I plan to follow the rules from the website of Educational Maze Puzzle Art, which is a relatively easy protocol for making a maze prototype with only a few branches. I can use this method resseting my scene become another random maze each time if I have a chance to implement it. The visual impact must be strong for readers, but I plan to focus more on this area in a future project.  


##### Mishra, S., & Bande, P. (2008). Maze Solving Algorithms for Micro Mouse. 2008 IEEE International Conference on Signal Image Technology and Internet Based Systems, 86–93. 

The Micro Mouse event, a competition for using autonomous robot mice to solve a maze in a shortest time, has almost 50 years of history. Mishra and Bande introduced a few entry level algorithms and logic for path planning and navigation. For the competition, the maze has 16 * 16 squares, and the goal is located in the center of the maze. Each robot has to search the whole maze, then calculate the path that costs the minimum time. 

The most basic algorithm is to either follow the left wall or right wall consistently. For example, in left-wall follower logic, the robot keeps moving straight if it can sense the left wall. If the left wall is empty, the robot turns left by 90 degrees to sense its reference wall, and then goes straight. Once the robot reaches the front wall, it will turn right by 90 degrees so that the front wall will become its left wall. To represent the position and direction of the robot, the maze is divided into an array of rows and columns. This algorithm is quite simple and has many limitations; it is therefore only suitable for particular mazes. 

Another way to solve the maze is Dijkstra’s algorithm. Using this model, the robot has to traverse the entire maze and set a few necessary nodes to generate an integrated paths graph. For each node in the graph, the robot will recompute the distance between the starting node and all its current neighbor nodes, and will replace the distance value from the distance set if the new distance from the beginning node to its neighbor node is shorter than previous. However, this algorithm has a critical problem: it requires a lot of time to go through all possible paths in the maze to obtain the shortest path from comparison.

Flood fill is one of the more efficient algorithms. It divides the maze into many cells and assigns different value to them according to their relative distance to the goal point. The adjacent cells of the goal point have small values, while the distant cells get larger values. To navigate the shortest path in the maze, robots only need to follow a path that is constant decreasing to zero, which is the goal point. 

All of the algorithms mentioned above are too simple to simulate a real bacterial chemotaxis, since micro mouse mazes usually don’t have too many complicated dead ends that trap robots It can be implemented for those situations where chemotaxis does not work or exist, wherein the bacterium still has to find a way out based on some rules that do not correspond to gradient. I also discovered an issue in the paper about the method for generating Dijkstra’s nodes: when searching the whole maze, the method only records nodes after the robot touches its front wall.  The robot will seemingly never enter the additional paths that occur in the middle of its current path, such as a T junction. Therefore, the robot is not able to search the maze completely, as some nodes will be missed.


##### Nakagaki, T., Yamada, H., & Tóth, Á. (2001). Path finding by tube morphogenesis in an amoeboid organism. Biophysical Chemistry, 92(1), 47–52. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0301-4622(01)00179-X

Nakagaki et al. found that an amoeboid organism can discover the shortest paths between two nutrient endpoints, and that it is possible to form a lengthy tube that connects each endpoint in a labyrinthine environment. External environmental stimuli, like nutrients, light, or temperature, may cause the plasmodium to propagate waves from its biochemical oscillators, and a non-linear oscillator in the environment may well help plasmodium to navigate the complicated paths.

Figure 3

In general, after cutting off a few small pieces from a plasmodium, they will soon spread and merge into a large sheet-like organism. By putting nutrients like oat flakes in two points on the plate, the organism itself will try to move to both nutrient points, thus turning into a tube (its vein) which is the shortest path between the nutrient points. In a complex labyrinth test, researchers initially filled the labyrinth with plasmodium. Since there are only four possible paths within two nutrient points (AG) in the Figure 3, the parts in the dead end would shrink first; later, the vein connecting the nutrient points with obvious longer paths would disconnect. The result may differ in different experiment; the paths with significant distance difference often occur in the shorter route tube. However, if two paths have similar distance, the occurrence possibility is equally likely. 

This article provides another way to solve a complex maze. The content emphasizes the pattern rather than the logic,  because the oscillation and its feedback are difficult to analyze and model. For my project, I can also generate a creature that fills up the whole maze according to its content; the creature will then slowly shrink and remove those paths (tentacles) that are useless or redundant, and finally, the only shortest way will appear. The most valuable thing I learned from this paper is that from examining the figure, the shortest path of the organism resembles an irregular variation, such as lightning with high voltages. Perhaps I can create an array for the previous path of bacteria and draw their path with a lightning pattern. The project should not only include the demonstration of robot’s ability to solve mazes, it should also contain some compelling interactive elements. For the generative art of maze solving, I have considered two possibilities: either decorating the bacteria’s path, or randomizing mazes by using the method Kim et al have described, as discussed below. 



##### Tweedy, L., Thomason, P. A., Paschke, P. I., Martin, K., Machesky, L. M., Zagnoni, M., & Insall, R. H. (2020). Seeing around corners: Cells solve mazes and respond at a distance using attractant breakdown. Science, 369(6507). https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aay9792

Tweedy et al. found that cells can use their self-made gradients (diffusing attractants) to obtain information from the local environment, thus enabling them to identify and navigate future favorable paths in both software models and living experiments. This behavior is based on their chemotaxis ability that is often used for cell migration; the behavior can also help cells to solve complex long-distance mazes. A simple chemotaxis with an imposed linear gradient usually detects fluid attractants and the external sink of the gradients, so it can only slowly guide the cells for a short distance. To solve a complex path, self-generated gradients were used in this experiment. It can not only analyze surroundings, but can also generate a real time dynamic gradient in order to move away from an area with crowded cells to a higher gradient place. In a simple maze, cells with self-made gradients will go into different branches equally to avoid overcrowding in the beginning. When they reach a dead end, the pioneer cells will consume the attractant rapidly, so the later cells will sense the low density and are unlikely to enter it anymore. The longer length of the dead end usually requires longer time to diffuse for the cells to sense, thus there are more cells that congregate in it erroneously. Although the error rate of a cell’s decision is initially high in a long and complex maze, the behaviour of cells will eventually become more accurate after the front attractants are depleted by the early cells. In addition, the error rate of decision can also be affected by the rate of diffusion: a high diffusion rate from attractants helps cells to make accurate decisions. Low diffusivity will deteriorate the decision, causing the cells to equally enter each branch without information. There is a specific situation that could lead to anomalous cellular behavior, unlike the above: a fake vast reservoir that is shorter than the true reservoir can lead cells to make critical error in their decisions. This is mostly because the broad dead end needs more time to be emptied or the signal from the real attractant is reduced and weakened.

This the core article of my project. I believe this paper goes beyond the existing research, which is relatively superficial, and holds potential interest for people in many fields; there are many aspects to replicate and discuss within this topic. In order to induce the bacteria to find the solution path successfully, the gradient must be carefully designed. An easy method I am considering is that no matter how complex the maze is, I will always divide it into different branches or short straight paths. I will then calculate each gradient respectively and generate a new color according to the percentage of its density.   



##### Xu, J., & Kaplan, C. S. (2007). Image-guided maze construction. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 26(3), 29–es. https://doi.org/10.1145/1276377.1276414

Xu and Kaplan have invented a method of transferring interesting regions and the tone of any photo into a maze. To construct a maze, they used the same method as the one described in design-centric maze generation: separating the photo or object into pieces, then constructing and connecting each cell together using a spanning tree. To maintain the style or expression of the images, mazes have to be designed on a region-by-region basis. Xu and Kaplan defined the different regions and styles by four textures: directional mazes, spiral or vortex mazes, random mazes, and user-defined lines. Directional mazes are normal mazes with anisotropy where the walls are assigned to flow with two perpendicular directions. I have introduced the spiral mazes with Berg’s article; this style can be used for depictions of specific objects, such as a round teapot. Random mazes are used for regions that can be defined by tone variation, and user-defined lines are used for faces that need to carefully pointed out. 

Other useful effects to improve the visual appeal of a maze include tone reproduction and foreshortening. To remake the tone, Xu and Kaplan also defined a relationship between line spacing, line width, and lightness. The lighter tones usually have thinner line width, with broader spaces between each line (wall) in the region. By contrast, dark tones have thicker, bolder lines, and darker tonal areas are more crowded. Meanwhile, foreshortening provides an interactive tool that can generate a perspective transformation based on the normal vectors of the photo. A designer can finish their mazes according to the inverse of that transformation, then re-apply the transformation to generate the foreshortening effect. 

It is interesting to observe the transference of realistic pictures to artistic mazes. As shown in the Figure 4, a maze can not only be a puzzle game for people to solve, but artists can also use mazes for a variety of purposes. For instance, a maze can serve as a pure visual art form to represent certain cultural and religious artifacts. To make a maze for mice more realistic, the maze could be designed in the shape of a map of New York, since the city is known for its rats. If a metastatic cancer cell is to solve a particular maze, the maze could be contoured like a human body.

For my first sketch, I have added a few bouncing effects. First of all, after detecting the collision event (the new point is out of canvas), the future points will all be calculated to a reverse direction by using `math.abs()` until the next collision. When the bouncing happens, I also add a little variant to the line's each point's position, so you will see the line begins to vibrate. What is more, to make the animation become more attractive, the line can switch to various colors by touching different edges. This animation is like a dynamic screensaver, but out of fashion, like from the 90s.

I haven't used javascript for over three years. The most time I spent on this sketch is to figure out how to use its array correctly. When I was debugging the yellowtail scripts that Graham provides to us, I found the marks array not only includes a few pair s of dx, dy value, but also the mouse initial x, y position, and then a boolean. After a little meditation and researching, I realized the same array in javascript is capable to include different types like numbers, booleans, and strings together. However, most js tutorial websites neither mention that nor give a proper example.

An issue I'm thinking for the whole week is to achieve perfect symmetry after relection. If I draw a specific pattern in the panel, after reflecting from the edge, neither the yellowtail script nor my codes can make the line remain the same as before ---- the pattern usually becomes an irregular curve after the bouncing.


<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3d6G_Tevzi12wrrPobva75ibK50ck8V9aGKRObVyzTrQ39CYxHZ3xsOpRx2tL9iQzIeM8hdR8_Ap1CaIGdNEJ9L_w2V-fJVAW17qaWbflhN9VcJXoZyDFSmrZufCKnz9ODfB23507lgx5eDdksH7827=w988-h969-no?authuser=0" width="200">

The script below is my initial thinking about this problem. Once the new point is out of the edge, the next vector should be exactly the last vector that brought the line to reach the edge but in a different direction. The vector after next should be the vector before last but in a different direction. 

For the array, each time I should pop the tail to return the previous vector, calculate and unshift the new point to the beginning of the array so the previous vectors will be retrieved from back to end one by one. Maybe?
Unfortunately, my script doesn't work well, but I think this concept is worth sharing.

```javascript
       //TO achieve a perfect sysmetry,

        
        first = mark.pop();
        //return current (last) point and remove it
        second = mark[mark.length - 2];
        //return the point before last point

        var newP;
        // create newpoint 

        dx = second.x - first.x;
        dy = second.y - first.y;
        //calculate the last vector from the end of array

        newP.x = first.x + dx;
        newP.y = first.y - dy;        
        //rotate the direction and assign to new point 

        mark.unshift(newP);
```


### Literature Review Part 1
Use Immersive virtual reality to help COVID-19 patients or healthcare workers.

The situation of immersive Virtual Reality in the medical field is similar to the game industry -- slow and nonsignificant. A majority of applications are about reducing pain (entertainment nature) and surgery simulation (most are simple softwares made by unity and maya3D, only a few are for commercial use e.g., OSSO VR)

Unlike vaccine worldwide competition, VR is silent these days(almost no research about covid-19).It doesn't keep pace with the epidemic.
#### My Direction (Maybe)
Easy: Repeat previous distraction experiments, using level design to improve the immersive experience for patients that have shortness of breath or difficulty breathing?

Difficult: Nucleic acid-based testing (PCR) simulation for the nurse? or further

##### Suggested Readings
###### Perception of the future and the future of perception

Let there be vision and there was light.

Our rules and principles are based on past knowledge. If the future always depends on the past, then the world and society will be hard to change. The modern world teaches people to follow those rules, and most of us become obedient as we grew up. Crow enjoys being ruled by the dominator (what we called elite class), so people won't decide or think about the future. 

In the article, Heinz mentions the insignificance of former information and relevance for a new future. We have to perceive our tomorrow first so we can achieve it later. This made me think the language we are using could also be the stumbling block that prevents us from perceiving the future or reaching a higher dimension. But after that, what will our perception eventually be like at that moment?

###### Vehicles: Experiments in synthetic psychology

The article starts with a simple vehicle. This vehicle eventually becomes alive by adding more sensors and more motors when interacting with multiple stimuli. Using the threshold for any action value can simulate a delay of preparation or rest that usually happens in life entities. Binding multiple thresholds with one activation element will generate a more realistic life. Alghouth the idea is not too complicated but the result (performance) always looks intricate.

Most AI I made was in video games, I usally randomize their animations and directions to simulate the dynamic patrolling. It is interesting to discover this new vehicle algorithm by adding more relative sensors and motors with various settings to make the virtual world full of life.



## WEEK 4
    
For this week's assignment, I made a multi-sensors vehicle based on the in-class sketch. The vehicle prefers to avoid its companions but chase the light source. It is not easy to calculate all incoming forces in a javascript program compared to any other game engine. So I use velocities to generate the next position (sum up the same direction velocity, subtract different directions velocity). The script still has some problems that sometimes the vehicle won't be affected by the light source; even they are close enough. More details and features will be shared in class.
