Seeing around corners: Cells solve mazes and respond at a distance using attractant breakdown is a newly-released paper published earlier this year. Awareness of its findings quickly spread through news and videos because of the amazing phenomenon observed by the researchers: cells rapidly navigating and solving different levels’ mazes for the attractant. I was deeply inspired by the video when I viewed it for the first time, which led me to the idea of extending this research in a more artistic way by reimplementation since this research is primarily focused on the scientific aspects, like the experimental methodology. Berg’s website and books also made great contributions to the mazes’ artistic aspect. Most papers I’ve read have all cited Berg’s work as a basis for maze generation. I’d like to see the results of combining Xu and Kaplan’s method of transferring photorealistic images into mazes with Berg’s design principles. Currently, since the paper was just released on the end of this August, there are no published research studies or reimplementation attempts based on the results of Seeing around corners. I believe there is a lot to say about this subject in the future, and further discoveries to be made in this area, whether in the scientific aspect or the artistic aspect.

### Annotated Bibliography


Xu, J., & Kaplan, C. S. (2007). Image-guided maze construction. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 26(3), 29–es. https://doi.org/10.1145/1276377.1276414

Xu and Kaplan have invented a method of transferring interesting regions and the tone of any photo into a maze. To construct a maze, they used the same method as the one described in design-centric maze generation: separating the photo or object into pieces, then constructing and connecting each cell together using a spanning tree. To maintain the style or expression of the images, mazes have to be designed on a region-by-region basis. Xu and Kaplan defined the different regions and styles by four textures: directional mazes, spiral or vortex mazes, random mazes, and user-defined lines. Directional mazes are normal mazes with anisotropy where the walls are assigned to flow with two perpendicular directions. I have introduced the spiral mazes with Berg’s article; this style can be used for depictions of specific objects, such as a round teapot. Random mazes are used for regions that can be defined by tone variation, and user-defined lines are used for faces that need to carefully pointed out. 
Other useful effects to improve the visual appeal of a maze include tone reproduction and foreshortening. To remake the tone, Xu and Kaplan also defined a relationship between line spacing, line width, and lightness. The lighter tones usually have thinner line width, with broader spaces between each line (wall) in the region. By contrast, dark tones have thicker, bolder lines, and darker tonal areas are more crowded. Meanwhile, foreshortening provides an interactive tool that can generate a perspective transformation based on the normal vectors of the photo. A designer can finish their mazes according to the inverse of that transformation, then re-apply the transformation to generate the foreshortening effect. 
It is interesting to observe the transference of realistic pictures to artistic mazes. As shown in the Figure 1, a maze can not only be a puzzle game for people to solve, but artists can also use mazes for a variety of purposes. For instance, a maze can serve as a pure visual art form to represent certain cultural and religious artifacts. To make a maze for mice more realistic, the maze could be designed in the shape of a map of New York, since the city is known for its rats. If a metastatic cancer cell is to solve a particular maze, the maze could be contoured like a human body.

For my first sketch, I have added a few bouncing effects. First of all, after detecting the collision event (the new point is out of canvas), the future points will all be calculated to a reverse direction by using `math.abs()` until the next collision. When the bouncing happens, I also add a little variant to the line's each point's position, so you will see the line begins to vibrate. What is more, to make the animation become more attractive, the line can switch to various colors by touching different edges. This animation is like a dynamic screensaver, but out of fashion, like from the 90s.

I haven't used javascript for over three years. The most time I spent on this sketch is to figure out how to use its array correctly. When I was debugging the yellowtail scripts that Graham provides to us, I found the marks array not only includes a few pair s of dx, dy value, but also the mouse initial x, y position, and then a boolean. After a little meditation and researching, I realized the same array in javascript is capable to include different types like numbers, booleans, and strings together. However, most js tutorial websites neither mention that nor give a proper example.

An issue I'm thinking for the whole week is to achieve perfect symmetry after relection. If I draw a specific pattern in the panel, after reflecting from the edge, neither the yellowtail script nor my codes can make the line remain the same as before ---- the pattern usually becomes an irregular curve after the bouncing.


<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3d6G_Tevzi12wrrPobva75ibK50ck8V9aGKRObVyzTrQ39CYxHZ3xsOpRx2tL9iQzIeM8hdR8_Ap1CaIGdNEJ9L_w2V-fJVAW17qaWbflhN9VcJXoZyDFSmrZufCKnz9ODfB23507lgx5eDdksH7827=w988-h969-no?authuser=0" width="200">

The script below is my initial thinking about this problem. Once the new point is out of the edge, the next vector should be exactly the last vector that brought the line to reach the edge but in a different direction. The vector after next should be the vector before last but in a different direction. 

For the array, each time I should pop the tail to return the previous vector, calculate and unshift the new point to the beginning of the array so the previous vectors will be retrieved from back to end one by one. Maybe?
Unfortunately, my script doesn't work well, but I think this concept is worth sharing.

```javascript
       //TO achieve a perfect sysmetry,

        
        first = mark.pop();
        //return current (last) point and remove it
        second = mark[mark.length - 2];
        //return the point before last point

        var newP;
        // create newpoint 

        dx = second.x - first.x;
        dy = second.y - first.y;
        //calculate the last vector from the end of array

        newP.x = first.x + dx;
        newP.y = first.y - dy;        
        //rotate the direction and assign to new point 

        mark.unshift(newP);
```


### Literature Review Part 1
Use Immersive virtual reality to help COVID-19 patients or healthcare workers.

The situation of immersive Virtual Reality in the medical field is similar to the game industry -- slow and nonsignificant. A majority of applications are about reducing pain (entertainment nature) and surgery simulation (most are simple softwares made by unity and maya3D, only a few are for commercial use e.g., OSSO VR)

Unlike vaccine worldwide competition, VR is silent these days(almost no research about covid-19).It doesn't keep pace with the epidemic.
#### My Direction (Maybe)
Easy: Repeat previous distraction experiments, using level design to improve the immersive experience for patients that have shortness of breath or difficulty breathing?

Difficult: Nucleic acid-based testing (PCR) simulation for the nurse? or further

##### Suggested Readings
###### Perception of the future and the future of perception

Let there be vision and there was light.

Our rules and principles are based on past knowledge. If the future always depends on the past, then the world and society will be hard to change. The modern world teaches people to follow those rules, and most of us become obedient as we grew up. Crow enjoys being ruled by the dominator (what we called elite class), so people won't decide or think about the future. 

In the article, Heinz mentions the insignificance of former information and relevance for a new future. We have to perceive our tomorrow first so we can achieve it later. This made me think the language we are using could also be the stumbling block that prevents us from perceiving the future or reaching a higher dimension. But after that, what will our perception eventually be like at that moment?

###### Vehicles: Experiments in synthetic psychology

The article starts with a simple vehicle. This vehicle eventually becomes alive by adding more sensors and more motors when interacting with multiple stimuli. Using the threshold for any action value can simulate a delay of preparation or rest that usually happens in life entities. Binding multiple thresholds with one activation element will generate a more realistic life. Alghouth the idea is not too complicated but the result (performance) always looks intricate.

Most AI I made was in video games, I usally randomize their animations and directions to simulate the dynamic patrolling. It is interesting to discover this new vehicle algorithm by adding more relative sensors and motors with various settings to make the virtual world full of life.



## WEEK 4
    
For this week's assignment, I made a multi-sensors vehicle based on the in-class sketch. The vehicle prefers to avoid its companions but chase the light source. It is not easy to calculate all incoming forces in a javascript program compared to any other game engine. So I use velocities to generate the next position (sum up the same direction velocity, subtract different directions velocity). The script still has some problems that sometimes the vehicle won't be affected by the light source; even they are close enough. More details and features will be shared in class.
